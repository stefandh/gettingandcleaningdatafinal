# Getting and Cleaning Data Final

The final course project for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Script Steps:
1. Downloads the data if it hasn't yet been downloaded.
2. Read the training data, test data, features, and activity labels.
3. Combines the individual data tables to make a single data table.
4. Finds and keeps only the needed data.
5. Cleans up column names.
6. Groups by subject and activity and summarizes using mean.
7. Creates a new file tidy_data.txt with the new data.
